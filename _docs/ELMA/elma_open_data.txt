Important note on use
NB! These datasets must not be used to check if a given norwegian organization is registered in PEPPOL or what documents an organization can receive. This should be done via a lookup via the SML (Service Metadata Locator).
See section below on how to do a proper lookup.
Datasets
We have previously published data sets of recipients in Elma at Datahotellet (hotell.difi.no). Datahotellet was discontinued on 11 February 2025. Elma will stop updating the datasets at 23 September 2024.

How to lookup participants in PEPPOL
The only valid way to lookup an organization is the PEPPOL way of lookup via the SML.
Previously, ELMA was the only PEPPOL SMP where norwegian organizations were registered. This is no longer the case. A norwegian organization may be registered to an other SMP. A lookup only in ELMA is no longer a valid way to lookup norwegian organizations in PEPPOL.
It is also possible to lookup organizations via PEPPOL Directory. It is currently not mandatory for SMPs to publish information to PEPPOL Directory, so the list there is not complete.
Recipe for creating the URL to lookup an organization can be found at helger.com
