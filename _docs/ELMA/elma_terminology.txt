Terminology
Here are some terms which will be used throughout the ELMA manuals.
Service provider (SP)
: A company that connects organizations to the Peppol network. A service provider is associated with one or more domains, and participants registered by the provider will only be approved for message exchange within the provider's domain(s).
Access point (AP)
: Represents a physical access point service endpoint, accessible through one or several URLs.
Endpoint
: An access point has one or more physical endpoints represented by a URL and transport profile.
Transport profile
: The transport method that must be used for communicating with a given AP. AS4 is an example of a transport profile.
Access point provider (APP) 
: An access point provider operates APs that the SPs can use by making an agreement.
Agreement
: An agreement between an SP and an APP for usage of a specific access point.
Processes
: Standardized, maintained collections of document types used in e-procurement.
Participants
: Organizations that are connected to the Peppol network. (An organization might act as its own SP.) You can think of this as a "contract" between an organization and an SP, that connects the SP's customer organizations to the Peppol network by means of the SP's associated APP's AP.
Certificates
: Your PEPPOL SP certificate.
Domains
: Collections of processes used in e-procurement.
Document types
: Standardized message types belonging to processes, used in communication between APs.
Identifier
: Identifier for a participant, consisting of a set prefix and an organization identifier. e.g. 9908:991825827
SML (Service Metadata Locator)
: A DNS that returns the address of the SMP that holds the metadata of a given PEPPOL receiver. The SML is the only centrally operated component in the PEPPOL transport infrastructure. It is managed by OpenPEPPOL and operates out of Brussels by DG/DIGIT.
