About
A resource server can introspect an access token to determine the active state of the token and/or to determine meta-information about this token.
To avoid information leakage, three conditions must be fulfilled for introspection to work:

The scope(s) in the token must be configured with the client_id of the resource server that should be allowed to introspect ()
This client_id must in addition be registered with the  scope
The client must perform client authentication on the introspection endpoint

Breaking change: Note that the behaviour above is a breaking change from the the old ID-porten.
The  endpoint is thoroughly documented in RFC 7662 OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection 
Request
The following header parameters must be used:
| Parameter  | Value |
| --- | --- |
|Http method:|POST|
|Content-type:|application/x-www-form-urlencoded|
The client calling /tokeninfo must be pre-registered, and must authenticate itself using the registered method of client authentication (ie ).
The following JSON payload must be submitted:
| Claim  | Value |
| --- | --- |
|token|\<The token that should be validated>|
Response
The most important parameter in the reponse is the -claim.  If its value is false, the submitted token is not longer valid, and must not be used or trusted by the sending party.
| claim | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| active | true / false | Authorative statement from ID-porten whether the submitted token is valid or not. |
The response will also include a number of claims related to the submitted token, and are equal to the claims available for self-contained access token.
Please note that the response from the token introspection-endpoint is NOT an access_token, even though it is a JWT.
Sample request:
```
POST /tokeninfo
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic xxxxx
token=fK0dhs5vQsuAUguLL2wxbXEQSE91XbOAL3foY5VR0Uk=
```
Sample response:

Introspection of pseudonymous tokens
If the scope in the access token was configured to trigger issuance of pseudonymous tokens, then the norwegian person identifier (-claim) will be included in the introspection response.
