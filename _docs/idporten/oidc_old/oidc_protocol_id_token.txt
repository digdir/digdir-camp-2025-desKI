Request
To request an id_token, use the /token endpoint.
The id_token
The id_token is the assertion of the authenticated user identity.  It tells you "who the user is", but not "what the user can access".  The id_token is meant to be consumed and validated by the client, to build a local session at the client.  It is not intended to be passed around to enable API access towards other parties/systems.
The id_token is a JWT structure, as documented in OIDC Core, 3.1.6.  The client MUST validate the id_token according to OIDC Core, 3.1.7.  
In addition, the client MUST validate that the security level () is sufficiently high for the given service.
Example:



id_token header claims
| claim | verdi |
| --- | --- |
| kid | "Key identifier" - unique identifier for the key and certificate used by ID-porten. The public key and the certificate must be fetched from our .well-known endpoint. |
| alg | "algorithm" - algorithm used for signing the token. ID-porten only supports  (RSA-SHA256) |
id_token body claims
| claim | value |
| --- | --- |
| sub | "subject identifier" - an unique identifier for the authenticated user.  The value is pairwise, meaning a given client will always get the same value, whilst different clients do not get equal values for the same user.  |
| aud | "audience" - The client_id of the client receiving this id_token  |
| acr | "Authentication Context Class Reference" - The security level of assurance for the authentication. Possible values are  (i.e.  MinID was used) or  (other eIDs). The level must be validated by the client. |
| auth_time | Timestamp indicating when the authentication was performed.  |
| amr | "Authentication Method References" - Method of authentication. Possible values can be seen below.  The available values may change over time, so the client should not validate this value. |
| iss | The identifier of ID-porten as can be verified on the .well-known endpoint|
| pid | "Personidentifikator" - the Norwegian national ID number (fødselsnummer/d-nummer) of the autenticated end user.   This claim is not included if  scope was requested or pre-registered on the client. |
| exp | Expire - Timestamp when this token should not be trusted any more.  |
| iat | Timestamp when this token was issued.  |
| jti | jwt id - unique identifer for a given token  |
| locale | The language selected by the user during the authentication in ID-porten |
| sid | session id - an unique identifier for end user session at ID-porten. May be needed when performing logout |
|at_hash| A hash of the access_token issued together with this id_token. The client may use this value to protect against access_token injections when using by-reference access tokens. |
