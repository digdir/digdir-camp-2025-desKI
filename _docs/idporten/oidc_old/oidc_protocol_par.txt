About
Pushed Authorization Requestes (PAR) and the  endpoint is thoroughly documented in the draft IETF-specification draft-ietf-oauth-par-06
PAR lets the client push the authorization request (see /authorize ) to ID-porten ahead of end-user involvement.

Response
The response is a  identifier, and an associated expiry time in seconds.
Sample response: {#authresponse}

Continue the authorization
The client must then use the request_uri and its client_id when redirecting the end user to the /authorize endpoint before the request_uri expires.

Request parameters  (apart from client_id) should not be repeated in the authorize-request, but if they are inclued, they must be excactly matching the values that was pushed in the PAR.
